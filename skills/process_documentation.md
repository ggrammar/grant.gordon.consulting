## Process Documentation

I'm a big fan of writing! I believe that a strong writing culture is critical to building and operating software at scale. 

There are a number of places where the written word should accumulate when building and operating software:
 - Statements of work (Jira tickets, user stories, problem tickets, etc)
 - Comments in the code itself
 - Commit messages
 - Pull requests
 - Documentation about the code
 - Teams/Slack/AIM messages 

Each of these serve their own purpose. 

In my experience, without this, it's more challenging to get up-to-speed, and it takes longer to complete tasks. 

## Unorganized Notes

 - What else do I want to put here?
	- Sitting on a Teams meeting, screen sharing. 
	- Likely need to work multiple late nights to get this done.
 - This is sort of turning into an article about how much I like documentation in general, not specifically process documentation.
