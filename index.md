## About Me

Hey there! My name is Grant Gordon. I'm a software engineer with more than ten years of experience helping companies solve problems. My expertise is in the wide umbrella of skills that folks call DevOps.

## What I Do

DevOps means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I like to say that I work on everything about software that isn't writing software[^ยน]. Things like:
 - [Building and Deploying Software (CI/CD)](./skills/cicd.html)
 - [Certificate Management](./skills/certificate_management.html)
 - [Performance Tuning](./skills/performance_tuning.html)
 - [Process Documentation](./skills/process_documentation.html)
 - [Cloud Cost Optimization](./skills/cloud_cost_optimization.html)
 - [Software Archaeology](./skills/software_archaeology.html)

For these problems and more, I build simple, practical solutions that are well-documented and easy to operate. Get in touch if you'd like to chat: 
  - Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grant-mattke-gordon/)
  - Email me at `grant.gordon+consulting@hey.com`

[^ยน]: That's not to say that I don't write software! The software I write focuses on the infrastructure supporting the business logic, rather than business logic itself.
