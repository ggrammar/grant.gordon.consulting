# Grant Gordon Consulting

Hey there! My name is Grant Gordon - I'm a software engineer with more than ten years of experience helping companies solve problems. My expertise is in the wide umbrella of skills that folks call DevOps.

DevOps means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I like to say that I work on everything about software that isn't writing software[^1]. Things like:
 - Building and Deploying Software (CI/CD)
 - Certificates
 - Performance Tuning
 - Process Documentation
 - Software Archaeology

[^1]: That's not to say I don't write software! What I write is more focused on the infrastructure that supports the business logic, rather than business logic itself.
