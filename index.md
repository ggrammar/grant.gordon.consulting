## About Me

Hey there! My name is Grant Gordon. I'm a software engineer with more than ten years of experience helping companies solve problems. My expertise is in the wide umbrella of skills that folks call DevOps.

## What I Do

DevOps means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I like to say that I work on everything about software that isn't writing software[^1]. Things like:
 - Building and Deploying Software (CI/CD)
 - Certificate Management
 - Performance Tuning
 - Process Documentation
 - Cloud Cost Optimization
 - Software Archaeology

For these problems and more, I build simple, practical solutions that are well-documented and easy to operate. Get in touch if you'd like to chat:

[^1]: That's not to say I don't write software! I write software focused on the infrastructure _supporting_ the business logic, rather than business logic itself.
