# grant.gordon.consulting

This repository contains the source code for my professional website, [grant.gordon.consulting](https://grant.gordon.consulting/).

I use GitHub Pages to run my website. I chose this technology for the same reasons that I choose other technologies:
 - It's simple to operate.
 - It's well-documented.
 - It manages certificates for me (what a relief!)
 - It's low-cost (I just pay for the domain name)

## Usage

Push any changes directly to the master branch. GitHub actions will automatically deploy the changes.

Worth noting - this isn't the branching strategy I would use for production-grade software!
