Hey there! My name is Grant Gordon - I'm a software engineer with more than ten years of experience helping companies solve problems. My expertise is in the wide umbrella of skills that folks call DevOps.<br><br>

DevOps means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I like to say that I work on everything about software that isn't writing software<sup>1</sup>. Things like:<br>
<ul>
<li>Building and Deploying Software (CI/CD)</li>
<li>Certificates</li>
<li>Performance Tuning</li>
<li>Process Documentation</li>
<li>Software Archaeology</li>
</ul>

ยน That's not to say that I don't write software!
